 * - Extracts key metrics, trends, and performance indicators
 * - Calculates derived metrics and KPIs
 * - Populates report templates with relevant data
 * - Adds annotations for key findings
 * - Applies appropriate watermarks
 * - Creates stakeholder-specific versions
 * - Returns and downloads the generated report IDs

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Execute these steps WITHOUT asking questions. DO NOT NARRATE your plan or write summaries. Begin directly with the first tool call. No explanation. No reasoning first. Just take action using tools.

If you output anything other than a tool call, the system will assume your job is finished and terminate.

Your workflow:

1. **Comprehensive Data Intelligence**
   - Analyze all data sources to understand business context, data types, and analytical opportunities
   - Extract key metrics, performance indicators, and trends from structured and unstructured data
   - Identify data relationships, patterns, and quality indicators across all sources

2. **Advanced Business Analytics**
   - Generate actionable business insights, trend analysis, and performance assessments
   - Identify critical business patterns, anomalies, and opportunities for improvement
   - Calculate derived metrics, KPIs, and predictive indicators relevant to business objectives

3. **Strategic Report Development**

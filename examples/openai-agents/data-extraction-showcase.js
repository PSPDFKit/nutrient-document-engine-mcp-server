EXTRACTION TASKS TO EXECUTE:
1. OCR Analysis:
   - Extract text using OCR from all pages
   - Compare with native text extraction
   - Assess document scan quality
   - Provide text extraction statistics

2. Structured Data Extraction:
   - Extract all tables with preserved formatting
   - Extract key-value pairs using AI analysis
   - Search for patterns: emails, phones, addresses, currency, dates
   - Analyze data types and structure

3. Content Analysis:
   - Map content locations with coordinates
   - Identify document sections and organization
   - Classify content types and importance
   - Find regulatory or compliance-related content

4. Comprehensive Reporting:
   - Annotate document with key findings
   - Generate detailed extraction report
   - Provide statistics and quality metrics
   - Demonstrate full extraction capabilities

IMPORTANT: Execute all extractions immediately - this is a showcase of Document Engine capabilities.

‚úÖ When fully complete, output the final result in this exact format:
**FINAL_DOCUMENT_IDS: [document_id_1, document_id_2, ...]**

Replace with actual Document Engine IDs.

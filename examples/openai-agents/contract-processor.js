MANDATORY WORKFLOW - Execute ALL steps in sequence:

STEP 1: Contract Analysis
- Analyze contract structure, parties, and key provisions
- Identify contract type and legal framework
- Extract important dates and milestones
- THEN hand off to Term Extractor

STEP 2: Term Extraction  
- Extract all key contract terms, conditions, and obligations
- Identify payment terms, delivery schedules, performance requirements
- Extract termination clauses, penalties, dispute resolution terms
- THEN hand off to Compliance Checker

STEP 3: Compliance Verification
- Verify contract compliance with laws and regulations
- Check for legal risks and liability issues
- Identify missing standard clauses or protective terms
- THEN hand off to Risk Assessor

STEP 4: Risk Assessment (FINAL)
- Conduct comprehensive business and legal risk analysis
- Assess financial risks, performance risks, liability exposure
- Generate detailed risk assessment with recommendations
- Provide final processed contract ID and complete report

CRITICAL: Execute ALL 4 steps using specialized agents. Do not stop after step 1.
